## Description
The SortAnArray program reads an integer value followed by an array of integers from user input, sorts the array in descending order, and prints the sorted values separated by commas. The program uses the built-in Arrays.sort() method and custom logic to reverse the order after sorting.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/SortAnArray.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd SortAnArray 
```
- Compile the SortAnArray.java file: 
```Java
- javac SortAnArray.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java SortAnArray
```

## Application Usage
The program expects two sets of inputs: The first input is an integer specifying how many numbers will be input. The second set of inputs contains the integers to be sorted. The program sorts the array of numbers in descending order. The output is the sorted numbers separated by commas. Example 

Input:
```Java
5 12 3 5 9 1 
```
Output:
```Java
12,9,5,3,1,
```
